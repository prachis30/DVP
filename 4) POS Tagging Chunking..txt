Experiment No. 4
POS Tagging Chunking.
Aim:
The aim of this practical is to implement and understand POS tagging and chunking techniques for
natural language processing tasks.

Lab Objectives:
Apply knowledge of parts of speech, understand the concept of chunking, and get familiar with the
basic chunk tagset.

Theory:
Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:
Part-of-speech tagging, often abbreviated as POS tagging, is a fundamental task in natural language
processing. It involves assigning grammatical categories (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) to
every word in a given text. This is crucial for understanding the syntactic structure of a sentence
and extracting meaning from it.

Details of POS tagging:

What is POS Tagging?
POS tagging is the process of automatically assigning a grammatical category (part of speech) to
each word in a sentence. In the sentence "He runs quickly", POS tagging would label "He" as a
pronoun, "runs" as a verb, and "quickly" as an adverb.

Importance of POS Tagging:
Syntactic Analysis: POS tagging helps in understanding the grammatical structure of a
sentence, which is crucial for more advanced NLP tasks like parsing.
Disambiguation: It helps resolve ambiguities that arise from homonyms (words with the same
spelling but different meanings) and polysemy (words with multiple meanings).
Information Extraction: POS tags can be used to identify entities, and relationships, and
extract useful information from text.

Common POS Tags:
Noun (NN): Represents a person, place, thing, or idea.
Verb (VB): Describes an action or state of being.
Adjective (JJ): Modifies or describes a noun.
Adverb (RB): Modifies or describes a verb, adjective, or other adverbs.
Pronoun (PRP): Takes the place of a noun (e.g., he, she, it).
Preposition (IN): Shows a relationship between a noun/pronoun and other words in a
sentence.
Conjunction (CC): Joins words, phrases, or clauses together.
Determiner (DT): Determines or limits a noun.
Interjection (UH): Expresses strong feelings or emotions.


Lab Outcomes:
Apply knowledge of parts of speech, understand the concept of chunking, and get familiar with the
basic chunk tagset.

Conclusions:
In conclusion, the practical application of Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and chunking is crucial in
natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction. These techniques play a pivotal role
by accurately identifying and categorizing the grammatical components of a text, enabling
machines to comprehend human language more effectively. POS tagging assigns linguistic labels
to words, facilitating tasks like sentiment analysis. Chunking groups words into meaningful
chunks, aiding in the extraction of relevant information and identification of syntactic structures.
Together, POS tagging and chunking enhance NLP systems, contributing to advancements in
language understanding and machine learning applications.
