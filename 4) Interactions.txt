Aim: 4.1 Create an interactive dashboard with text and visual tooltips by using drill-down
4.2 Interactivity with text and visual tooltips,Interactivity with actions (filter,
highlight,URL),Drilldown between dashboards

Lab Objective: To build an interactive dashboard with text and visual tooltips, supporting
actions like filtering and drill-down navigation between dashboards, enhancing the user experience
and data exploration.

Theory:
4.1
Creating an interactive dashboard with text and visual tooltips using a drill-down approach
involves designing a dynamic data visualization interface that enables users to explore information
in a hierarchical manner. It typically commences with a high-level overview, presenting summary
statistics or key performance indicators (KPIs) to offer users a top-level perspective of the data.

High-Level Overview: Start with a high-level view of the data, such as summary statistics or key
performance indicators (KPIs). This provides users with a bird's-eye view of the information.
Interactive Elements: Design the dashboard with interactive elements, such as clickable charts,
graphs, or data points. Users can click on these elements to access more detailed information.
Text and Visual Tooltips: Implement tooltips that display relevant information when a user hovers
over or clicks on a specific data point. Tooltips can include text descriptions, additional statistics,
or even visual aids like pop-up charts.

Interactivity with Text and Visual Tooltips:
Interactivity with text and visual tooltips is a critical feature in data visualization and dashboard
design. It involves providing users with additional information and context by allowing them to
hover over or click on data points, charts, or other elements within a dashboard.

Interactivity with Actions (Filter, Highlight, URL):
Interactivity with actions in a dashboard allows users to manipulate and interact with the data to
extract meaningful insights and perform specific tasks. This includes features like filtering,
highlighting, and linking to external resources through URLS.

1. Filtering: Users can apply filters to the data to narrow down what they are viewing,
focusing on specific subsets or timeframes. Filters enable users to customize their data analysis
and answer specific questions. For example, in an e-commerce dashboard, users might filter sales
data to view results for a particular product category or location.

2. Highlighting: Highlighting lets users emphasize particular data points, making it easier to
identify trends, outliers, or important information. It is a valuable tool for visual data analysis and
storytelling within the dashboard.

3. URL Links: Incorporating URL links allows users to access external resources or websites
directly from the dashboard. For instance, a dashboard tracking news articles can link to the full
articles or related web pages for additional context and information.
These interactive actions empower users to interact with the data and customize their experience,
making the dashboard a versatile tool for data exploration, analysis, and decision-making.

Lab Outcome:
The lab outcome suggests that using an interactive dashboard with text and visual
tooltips in a drill-down approach enhances data exploration and insight generation,
providing a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making
Conclusion:
In conclusion, creating an interactive dashboard with text and visual tooltips usin a
drill-down approach involves steps such as providing a high-level overview, adding
interactive elements, text and visual tooltips, and a hierarchical structure. It aims to
empower users to explore data, maintain data consistency, and gain valuable insights for
makin informed decisions.
