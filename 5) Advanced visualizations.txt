Aim: 5.1 Create more advanced data visualization dashboards by using complex
Calculation
5.2 Using multiple source tables

Objective: To create more advanced data visualization dashboards by incorporating complex
calculated fields for in-depth data analysis and insights, and to optimize user interaction by
organizing dashboard filters in a tabular layout, streamlining data exploration for more efficient
and customized data-driven decision-making.

Theory:
5.1
Creating more advanced data visualization dashboards using complex calculated fields
involves leveraging the power of custom calculations and formulas to extract deeper insights and
present data in a more meaningful way.
Complex calculated fields enable the dashboard designer to go beyond basic data presentation and
engage in more advanced data manipulation and analysis. 

This can include:
Advanced Metrics: Calculating sophisticated performance metrics and KPIs that are not readily
available in the raw data. For example, creating a custom profitability index based on various
financial data points.

Statistical Analysis: Implementing statistical functions to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies
within the data. This may involve calculating correlations, regressions, or statistical significance.

Data Transformations: Using complex formulas to transform the data, such as normalizing values,
aggregating data at different levels, or applying mathematical models to predict future trends.
Conditional Logic: Incorporating conditional statements within calculated fields to categorize or
label data points based on specific criteria. This can be useful for segmenting data into different
groups or identifying outliers.

Using multiple source tables in Tableau involves integrating data from various datasets or
tables to create a unified and comprehensive dataset for visualization and analysis. This process
includes the following key principles:
1. Data Integration: Combining data from multiple source tables allows for a more holistic
view of the information. This integration often requires a common key or field that links the data
across tables, facilitating the merging process.
2. Data Blending: In cases where there is no direct relationship between the tables, data
blending can be used to bring data together. Tableau provides a Data Blending feature to join data
from different tables based on related dimensions.
3. Join Types: Different join types (inner, left, right, outer) can be employed to control which
data is included in the merged dataset. The choice of join type depends on the specific requirements
of the analysis.
Data Cleanup: Prior to integration, it's essential to clean and prepare the data in each source
table, ensuring consistency in field names, data types, and formatting to facilitate smooth
integration.
5. Relationships: Establishing relationships within Tableau helps define how tables are
connected, which fields are used as keys, and how they interact with each other in visualizations.
These relationships are important for maintaining data accuracy and structure.
6. Data Performance: When working with multiple source tables, data performance becomes
a critical consideration. Optimizing data extracts and query performance can involve aggregation,
filtering, or other techniques to ensure that the dashboard remains responsive and efficient

Lab Outcome:
Using multiple source tables in Tableau enables the integration of data from various datasets, fostering comprehensive visualizations and informed decision-making while ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

Conclusion:
In summary, using multiple source tables in Tableau enhances data integration and
visualization, facilitating informed decision-making. It ensures comprehensive insights
while maintaining data accuracy.
