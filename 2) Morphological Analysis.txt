Experiment No. 2
Morphological Analysis
Aim:
The aim of the practical is to conduct morphological analysis to understand and analyze the structure of
linguistic forms.

Lab Objectives:
To apply and demonstrate the basics of morphological analysis for word formation.

Theory:
a Morphology analysis is a linguistic study that deals with the internal structure of words in
language. It explores how words are formed from smaller meaningful units called morphemes.
Morphemes are the smallest grammatical units in a language that carry meaning.


Here are the key components and concepts of morphology analysis:
Morpheme:
As mentioned earlier, a morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in a language. It can be a word
itself or a part of a word (prefixes, suffixes, etc.). For example, in the word "unhappiness," there are
three morphemes: "un-"(meaning 'not'), "happy" (meaning 'joyful'), and"-ness" (indicating a state
or quality).

Free and Bound Morphemes:
Free morphemes can stand alone as words by themselves and carry meaning. For example,
English, words like "dog," "run," and "book" are free morphemes.
in
Bound morphemes can't stand alone and must be attached to other morphemes to convey meaning.
Prefixes like "un-" or suffixes like "-ed" are examples.

Inflectional vs. Derivational Morphemes:
Inflectional morphemes alter the form of a word to indicate grammatical information like tense,
case, number, etc. For example, in English, "-s" in "cats" indicates plural. Derivational morphemes
are used to create new words or change the grammatical category of a word.
For example, adding "-ness" to "happy" creates "happiness," changing an adjective to a noun.

Morphological Processes:
Affixation: This involves adding prefixes (before the root) or suffixes (after the root) to a word. For
example, adding "-ing" to "read" forms "reading."
Compounding: It involves combining two or more free morphemes to create a new word. For
instance, "blackboard" combines "black" and "board."
Reduplication: This process involves repeating a morpheme or part of it to create a new word. For
example, in Tagalog, "tawa" (laugh) becomes "tatawa" (will laugh).
Blending: This involves combining parts of two words to create a new one, often through truncation
or fusion. For example, "brunch" combines "breakfast" and "lunch."
Conversion (Zero Derivation): This is a process where a word changes its grammatical category
without any overt morphological change. For example, "to google" (verb) from the proper noun
"Google."
Allomorphy: This refers to the variation in pronunciation of a morpheme depending on its context.
For example, the plural morpheme in English can be pronounced as/s/ (cats) or/z/ (dogs) depending
on the preceding sound.


Lab Outcome:
Apply and demonstrate the basics of morphological analysis for word formation.

Conclusions:
In conclusion, Morphological Analysis proves its worth as a valuable and versatile tool with
applications in diverse fields. Its systematic approach to breaking down complex systems facilitates
comprehensive understanding, aiding in problem-solving, decision-making, and system
optimization. By dissecting the morphology of entities, this method offers a structured approach,
fostering creativity and efficiency in engineering, decision science, strategic planning, and beyond.
Its adaptability makes Morphological Analysis a valuable asset for addressing multifaceted
challenges across various disciplines.
